Hi, my name is Jozef Kamensky. I am full stack developer striving to deliver solutions - not just some code - that help customers do their jobs more efficiently, comfortably and without losing their sanity. Beacuse after all, we do not program just for sake of programming (at least in our jobs), but to help our customers.
